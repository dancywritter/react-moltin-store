## React-Moltin store (In progress)

This project's goal is to create a store using the React.js framework coupled with the Molt.in e-commerce engine.

For now you can:
- Authenticate through Firebase
- Add items to your Molt.in cart
- Create a shipping address
- Create an order

Start the project with:

```
npm start
```

### Coming next:

- Shipping calculation and management using the Shippo API
- Displaying the order history
